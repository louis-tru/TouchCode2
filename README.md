Touch Code 2
===============

This is a tool for reading and modifying code based on [`Ngui`](https://github.com/louis-tru/ngui).
When you couldnâ€™t use the computer, you can synchronize the code from the FTP, 
SFTP, SVN, and synchronize to the server after modified quickly. The development tools 
can highlight error code for real-time , 
and also can log on SSH to run the shell. If you are a web front programmer, 
you can run a server and use a browser to view the modified results for real-time.
